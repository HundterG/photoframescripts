# Attachment Downloader

These are 2 projects that were created for my custom photo frame that can automatically download pictures that were sent to it from a computer or phone via email.

# Thunderbird

In the Thunderbird folder, there is the first attempt creating a plugin that downloads attachments from incomming emails. This is easyer to setup if you have a device that can run Thunderbird. Specific setup instructions are in the readme in that folder.

# Custom

The Custom folder contains a C++ project that was made to interface with Gmail and only Gmail. It containes only the code to download attachments (not a full email client) and can only be used on Unix/Linux systems. It takes much less resources to run though so it can be used on less powerful hardware. Specific setup instructions are in the readme in that folder.
